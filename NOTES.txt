current:
- get rid of flickering after adding vertical walls (call erase on sections?)
- warn when screen too small
- have fixed dash distance instead of duration
- maybe reorganize entities?

DONE:
- home screen
- death screen
- think of some other game mechanics with other mobs
- reimplement drawing so that spaces don't overwrite existing characters
- make player red when taking damage
- add immunity right after taking damage
- fix timers running when in home screen
  - Maybe initialize game on "play" instead of when starting the application
- when resizing vertically, player could skip over enemies
- when resizing vertically, enemies stay at their respective y locations
